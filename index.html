    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia, currently in my third year of study.
        Recently, I've developed an interest in applying machine learning to the oil and gas industry, something that 
        stemmed from my co-op experience at Condor Energies.

        <h3>Pet Rescue: Autonomous Robot (Summer 2025)</h3>

        <p>
          My ENPH 253 team (<a class="links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-jones1/">Luca Jones</a>,
          <a class="links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harchetan-chohan-504557327/">Harchetan Chohan</a>,

          designed and built an autonomous rescue robot capable of navigating a complex obstacle course,
          identifying and retrieving ‚Äúpet‚Äù targets, and returning them safely to the home zone, all without human control.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The brain of our robot was an <em>ESP32 microcontroller</em>, chosen for its power and versatility.
            A custom state machine was built to manage the various modes of operation such as line following and pet detection.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The navigation of the robot relies on infrared LEDs and phototransistors to detect the line of electrical tape
            that traces throughout the entire course. By reading which phototransistors are on or off, the robot can determine
            its relative position to the line and make adjustments using <em>PID control</em> to stay on course.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To identify and rescue the pets, our robot utilizes <em>2D time-of-flight sensors</em>
            to detect the presence of pet targets. To grab the pets, our robot uses a custom
            <em>planar 2-bar linkage arm</em> and a <em>4-bar claw</em> to pick up the pet and store it
            in the bucket on board the robot. The arm and claw were built using
            <em>3D printing</em>, <em>laser cutting</em>, and <em>water-jet cutting</em>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To lift the bucket and hook it to the zipline, we designed a
            <em>continuous cascade mechanism</em> that uses a DC motor to wind a rope around a spool,
            lifting the bucket vertically.

            <h3> Document Translator (Winter 2025)</h3>
            During my coop at <a class=links href="https://condorenergies.ca/">Condor Energies</a>, I developed a pipleine that automates the process of translating documents from Uzbek, Russian
            and Kazakh to English. For this project I had to handle a wide variety of document types such as scanned PDFs, Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. Each had 
            its own challenges when it came to extracting text as well as writing the translated text back into the original format.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4> Scanned PDFs </h4>
            This involved using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from scanned documents such as old
            drilling reports and well logs. Then using the Google translate API to translate the extracted text before
            finally writing the translated text back into a new PDF that closely resembled the original document. A particular challenge
            with this task was ensuring the formatting and layout of the original document was preserved in the translated version. For most PDFs
            I was dealing with they were scanned documents, so in order to write the translated text back to the PDF I had to 'remember' the pixel
            location of each word in the original document and then write the translated text back to those same locations. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Here is a first attempt at writing translated text back to a scanned PDF (fake document):

        </p>

        <p>
            After a lot more iteration I was able to get much better results that preserved the original formatting and layout of the document (fake document):

            üöß UNDERCONSTRUCTION üöß
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4> Word, Excel, PowerPoint </h4>
            For these document types I used the python-docx, openpyxl and python-pptx libraries to extract text from the documents,
            translate them using the Google Translate API, and then write the translated text back into new documents. This was much more
            straightforward than dealing with scanned PDFs, but still required careful handling to ensure formatting and layout were preserved. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is an example of translating a Word document from Russian to English (fake document):

        <h3> Production Forecasting Automation Tool (Winter 2025)</h3>
        <strong> Tools Used:</strong> Microsoft VBA, <a class=links href="https://manual.whitson.com/modules/well-performance/decline-curve-analysis/">Arps Equation (decline curve equation) </a> <br/>
        <p>
            During my coop at <a class=links href="https://condorenergies.ca/">Condor Energies</a>, I developed an automation tool
            to streamline the production forecasting process for natural gas wells. The tool ingests historical production data, 
            cleans and preprocesses it, and then applies decline curve analysis to forecast future production rates. The tool generates field-level 
            and well-level forecasts, complete with visualizations and summary reports. The tool successfully reduced about 3 days worth of work for a resevoir engineer 
            down to just a few hours once per month.
