    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am an Engineering Physics studnet at the University of Brithish Columbia. 
        Currently I am in my third year of study. I have recenetly became interested in applying Machine Learning in the Oil and Gas industry. 
        This passion came from my co-op experience at Condor Energies.

        <h3>Pet Rescue: Autonomous Robot</h3>

        <p>
          My ENPH 253 team (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-jones1/">Luca Jones</a>,
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harchetan-chohan-504557327/">Harchetan Chohan</a>,
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taichikamei/">Taichi Kamei</a>)
          designed and built an autonomous rescue robot capable of navigating a complex obstacle course,
          identifying and retrieving ‚Äúpet‚Äù targets, and returning them safely to the home zone, all without human control.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The brain of our robot was an <strong>ESP32 microcontroller</strong>, chosen for its power and versatility.
          A custom state machine was built to manage the various modes of operation such as line following and pet detection.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The navigation of the robot relies on infrared LEDs and phototransistors to detect the line of electrical tape
          that traces throughout the entire course. By reading which phototransistors are on or off, the robot can determine
          its relative position to the line and make adjustments using <strong>PID control</strong> to stay on course.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To identify and rescue the pets, our robot utilizes
          <a href="https://www.digikey.ca/en/product-highlight/s/stmicroelectronics/vl53l8cx-time-of-flight-sensor">
            <strong>2D time-of-flight sensors</strong>
          </a>
          to detect the presence of pet targets. To grab the pets, our robot uses a custom
          <strong>planar 2-bar linkage arm</strong> and a <strong>4-bar claw</strong> to pick up the pet and store it
          in the bucket on board the robot. The arm and claw were built using
          <strong>3D printing</strong>, <strong>laser cutting</strong>, and <strong>water-jet cutting</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To lift the bucket and hook it to the zipline, we designed a
          <strong>continuous cascade mechanism</strong> that uses a DC motor to wind a rope around a spool,
          lifting the bucket vertically.
