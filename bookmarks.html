    <h2>Industry Case Studies</h2>

      <h2> My Thoughts </h2>
      <p> 
      While at Condor Energies, the engineer I was working under asked me to take on a small side project. He asked me to research how oil and gas companies are approaching digitization. Naturally, he pointed me toward the big consulting firms: McKinsey & Co, KPMG, Deloitte, and the like. But I couldn’t find any truly concrete case studies of major digitization in the oil and gas sector. Most of what I came across described “digitization” as a vague idea rather than something tangible. 
      </p>

      <p>
      After a few hours of digging, I came across the partnership between C3 AI and Shell. This case study was the first time I had seen a proper all out attempt at digitization. Shell invested heavily in things like data infrastructure, predictive maintenance, and large scale integration across thousands of devices. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Before coming across this case study I did see that almost always consulting firms stressed the importance of having central leadership surrounding digitization. After watching the interview with the team responsible for the Shell project it was clear that Shell also prioritized this as well. From what I could tell it was clear that having this central leadership played a key role in the project's success.
      </p>

      <p>
      A few years after the deployment of the AI solutions at Shell, C3 AI, Baker Hughes, Shell and Microsoft came together to launch the Open AI Energy Initiative (OAI) in 2021. <i>The OAI provides a framework for energy operators, service providers and equipment providers to offer interoperable solutions, including AI and physics-based models, monitoring, diagnostics, prescriptive actions and services for energy use cases.</i> It is clear that without Shell being a leader in digitization the formation of a framework like the OAI would have been delayed by many years.
